## What we Organise

### Warhammer 40K
We run regular RTT (Rogue Trader Tournament, i.e. 1 day events, where three games are played) every month. They usually take place on the 2nd or 3rd Sunday of every month. Every year, we also run a League from January to June, with 9 games spread through this period.

We've recently started organising GTs (Grand Tournaments, i.e. 2-day events where five games are played over the course of a weekend). The first one will run on the 22nd and 23rd of November 2025.
